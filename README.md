# Crash Course in Linear Algebra for Data Scientists
v 0.0.2

## Goals
Provide a basic approach to Linear Algebra which is more thoroughly motivated for Data Scientists.

This approach emphasizes the spectral aspects of the theory.
It is designed to be used as a supplement by a teacher who is emphasizing what students need to know.

## Non-Goals
This is not an abstract algebra driven course.
It has no intentions of covering all of the aspects of the theory.

This will probably not be a standalone replacement for actually having a teacher.

## Tentative Outline
1.  Basic Operation
2.  Vector Spaces
3.  PCA and Regression
4.  Linear Transformations
5.  Invertible Matrix Theorem
6.  Graph Representations

## Check out the ipython notebooks for the actual sections.
